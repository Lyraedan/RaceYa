Dissonance PUN2 Integration
===========================

This package integrates Dissonance Voice Chat (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/dissonance-voice-chat-70078?aid=1100lJDF) with
the Photon Unity Networking 2 (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922?aid=1100lJDF) networking system. To use this package you must have purchased and installed Dissonance and PUN2 - **you will
encounter build errors until you have done this**!

The included demo scene (Assets/Dissonance/Integrations/PhotonUnityNetworking2/Demo/PUN2 Demo) demonstrates the basics of a voice
chat session running in a PUN2 network session. Consult the readme file in the demo folder for details on how to run
the demo and what features it demonstrates.
